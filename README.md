The following is an example of a story that was generated by the model after training on the TinyStories dataset:

Once upon a time, there was a little boy who wanted to play a game. He went up to a tree and had lots of fun riding through the branches.
When he got to the top of the tree, he saw how tall he had seen. Then, he saw a little girl playing in the sunshine.
The boy ran down the tree and said, "Hi little girl!" The girl smiled and said, "Hi, do you want to play soccer with me to play?"
The boy shook his head back and said, "Yes! Let's play!"
So, the boy and the little girl played lots of games and had so much fun. They laughed and played games and laughed all day at the park.
He and the girl would often play together again.
